# Architecture
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture
This project is built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. MVVM is a design pattern that helps organize code by separating the user interface (View) from the business logic (Model), improving testability and code readability.

Model: Represents the data layer of the application. It handles data structures, API calls, or database operations.\n
View: The user interface that displays data and captures user interactions.\n
ViewModel: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It processes data, prepares it for display, and communicates with the View through data binding.

This structure provides a modular and maintainable codebase by clearly separating UI logic from application logic.
